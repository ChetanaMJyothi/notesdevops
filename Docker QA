To install Docker 
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
Q. To view all Environmnet variables passed through a file can be viewed using a command: export -p --> inside a container

Q. similar to Docker?
RancherOS, PhotonOS, and Containers by Docker.

Q. Containerization?
Container technology involves building software packages that perform consistently, regardless of the machines they run on.
 Containers only package the resources required to run a single application.

Q. Diff between virtulization and containers?
Virtual amchines:
1. Applications running on a hypervisor, can run different OS.
2. VM size is very large,
3. VM takes longer to run than containers,
4. VM virtualizes the computer system, meaning its hardware.
5. VM is more secure, as the underlying hardware isnâ€™t shared between processes.

Container:
1. While applications running in a container environment share a single OS.
2. While the size of the container is very light,
3. While containers take far less time to run.
4. While containers virtualize the operating system, or the software only.
5. While containers are less secure, as the virtualization is software-based, and memory is shared.

Q. WORKDIR instruction is used to set the working directory for all the subsequent Dockerfile instructions.  
The WORKDIR instruction in a Dockerfile is used to set the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the 
Dockerfile. It allows you to change the current working directory for the duration of the Dockerfile.

Q. EXPOSE instruction is used to inform Docker that container listens at a specified port number, it is used only for inter-container communication 
which are on same host
FROM ubuntu:latest
EXPOSE 80/tcp
EXPOSE 80/udp
-p will do both expose and publish
It is not compulsory,its for documentation purpose, to tell on which ports container listens.
[expose creates internal communication, -p creates external connection previously, now its changed] ---> old one

Q. USER:
You can change or switch to a different user inside a Docker Container using the USER Instruction. For this, you first need to create a user and a group inside the Container.
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN groupadd -r user && useradd -r -g user user
USER user

Q. SHELL:
The SHELL instruction allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden. The default shell on Linux is ["/bin/sh", "-c"], 
and on Windows is ["cmd", "/S", "/C"]. 
The SHELL instruction must be written in JSON form in a Dockerfile.
The -c flag is a command option used by Bash (Bourne Again SHell) to run a command specified as its argument.
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

Q. differnce between -p and -P in docker commands
		-p (lowercase):
Syntax: -p <host-port>:<container-port>[/protocol]
docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app
This option allows you to manually specify the port mapping between the host machine and the container.
For example, to map port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the container, you would use: -p 8080:80.
		-P (uppercase):
This option is used to automatically map all exposed ports in the container to random ports on the host.
docker run -P my-web-app

Q. How to copy files from host machine to running container? 
docker cp /home/ubuntu/dir1/file1 5310a6a379f2:/dir/
5310a6a379f2 -->container ID

Q. Where intermediate images will be stored?
in local , use docker images -a

Q. Docker is written on GO language
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 811137303802.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
