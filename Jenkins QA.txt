1. What is DevOps?
 Devops is a culture/practise that collaborates Development Team and Operation teams, It will improve speed and quality of software delivery process 
 by automating developing, testing, deploying, maintaining processess.

 


2. Differnet plugins i have come across?
1. Build Authorization Token Root?
Examples
buildByToken/build?job=RevolutionTest&token=TacoTuesday

2. Role based authorization strategy?
3. fanin plugin --> To maintain upstream downstream jobs

Q. jenkins Home dir?
/var/lib/jenkins

Q. Default No of executors for Master node is 2, Quite period is 5 seconds

Q. Default jekins port : 8080

Q. Email configuration?
Under System we have extended email notification

Q. Different types of jobs in jenkins?
	Freestyle jobs: Classic, general-purpose job type that checks out from up to one SCM, executes build steps serially, followed by post-build steps like 
								archiving artifacts and sending email notifications.
	Pipeline: 	Suitable for building pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type.
	Multi-configuration project: Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on multiple environments, 
													platform-specific builds, etc.
	Multibranch Pipeline: Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.
	Organization folder: Creates a set of multibranch project subfolders by scanning for repositories.
	Maven Jobs:
	
Q. Where we craete credentails?
	Manage jenkins >> Credentails >> System >> Global credentails
 
 Q. Jenkins Best Practices?
 1. Always create a backup of the Jenkins Home Directory, Thin Backup Plugin, Periodic Backup Plugin
 2. Create a Scalable Jenkins Pipeline: Shared Libraries are the apex of adoption. Compared to a standard programming library, 
		shared libraries provide version-controlled Pipeline code
 3. Using RBAC
	Global roles, Item roles, Agent roles
 4. Distribute load through Master Agent
 5. Mange Credentials through credential binder plugin
 
 Q. Jenkins Challenges?
 -Configuration Management: Managing and configuring Jenkins can be challenging, especially when dealing with large and complex projects
 -Plugins that go out of date can cause issues when we upgrades jenkins server.
 -Troubleshooting is hard as some plugins have bad error handling.
 -Console output doesn't provide proper exact error message.
 -Since everything is depending on plugin, some plugins may be malicious and bring threat to jenkins , since it is open source platform.
 
 Q. Troubleshoot Jenkins?
 Jenkins fails to start or displays errors during startup:
	Check the Jenkins logs (JENKINS_HOME/logs) for any error messages
	Verify that the required Java version is installed and properly configured.
	Check if there are any port conflicts with other services running on the machine.
	Ensure that the file system has sufficient disk space available.
Build failures or job execution problems:
	Review the console output of the failed build for any error messages or stack traces.
	Check the job configuration for any misconfigured build steps or parameters.
	Verify that the required plugins and dependencies are installed and up to date.
Connectivity issues with Jenkins agents or nodes:
	Verify that the agents are registered and online in the Jenkins master.
Plugin-related problems:
	Check if the plugins are installed and up to date. Update or reinstall them if needed.
	Disable or remove conflicting plugins that may cause compatibility issues.
Performance optimization:
		Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and scale the Jenkins environment accordingly.
		Consider using distributed builds to offload the workload to multiple agents or nodes.
		
Q. Error in execution of pipeline jobs?
	1.Java mismatch error
	2.Nodes not getting connected
	3.build timeout
	4.Jenkins has no access to certain files or folders
	5. mistake inconfiguration of plugins
