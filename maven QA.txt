-An EAR file requires a fully Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)- or Jakarta Enterprise Edition (EE)-compliant application server, such as WebSphere or JBoss,to run. 
-A WAR file only requires a Java EE Web Profile-compliant application server to run
-A JAR file only requires a Java installation.
Basically, EAR files are a superset containing WAR files and JAR files
---
EAR files themselves must have an application.xml file contained within a folder named META-INF.
A WAR file requires a web.xml file contained within a WEB-INF folder.
Java files have neither of these requirements.
