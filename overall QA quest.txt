1. How to increase swap space in Linux?
Login as root.
sudo su
cd /var
touch swapfile
chmod 600 swapfile
ls -la swapfile
Use “dd” command to fill the swap file with 1 GB size --> dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swapfile bs=1024k count=1000
Now setup the swap file  --> mkswap /var/swapfile
Enable the swap file  --> swapon /var/swapfile
cat /proc/swaps
Disable the swap file --> swapoff /var/swapfile 
Delete the swap file --> rm /var/swapfile

2. Can we change .m2 Folder?
option 1: Set the M2_HOME Environment Variable:
export M2_HOME=/path/to/custom/m2/directory

3. What is hotfix?
-A hotfix refers to a small, targeted patch or update designed to address a specific issue or problem in software. 
-It's usually released as an urgent remedy to fix critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, or issues that are impacting the functionality or security of a software product.
-In DevOps, a hotfix refers to a rapid corrective measure applied to a software system or application to resolve critical issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, or operational 
failures. It's a part of the continuous delivery and deployment practices, allowing teams to respond swiftly to urgent problems that require immediate attention.

4. What is Artifatory?
It serves as a central hub for managing software artifacts such as binaries, packages, libraries, Docker containers
Artifactory plays a crucial role in modern software development practices by providing a central, organized, and secure repository for managing artifacts, 
facilitating collaboration among development teams, and ensuring the efficiency and reliability of the software delivery pipeline.
-It hosts artifacts, Its a place where artifacts are stored, Ex JFrog


5. What is 2/2 Status Check?
System status checks
System status checks monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs. 
These checks detect underlying problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. 
When a system status check fails, you can choose to wait for AWS to fix the issue, or you can resolve it yourself. 
For instances backed by Amazon EBS, you can stop and start the instance yourself, which in most cases results in the instance being migrated to a new host. 
For Linux instances backed by instance store, you can terminate and replace the instance. For Windows instances, the root volume must be an Amazon EBS volume; 
instance store is not supported for the root volume. Note that instance store volumes are ephemeral and all data is lost when the instance is stopped.

The following are examples of problems that can cause system status checks to fail:
Loss of network connectivity
Loss of system power
Software issues on the physical host
Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability
If a system status check fails, we increment the StatusCheckFailed_System metric.

Instance status checks
Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. 
Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). 
These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, you typically must address the problem yourself 
(for example, by rebooting the instance or by making instance configuration changes).

The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:
Failed system status checks
Incorrect networking or startup configuration
Exhausted memory
Corrupted file system
Incompatible kernel
If an instance status check fails, we increment the StatusCheckFailed_Instance metric.

6. What are git hooks?
All Git hooks are ordinary scripts that Git executes when certain events occur in the repository.
Hooks reside in the .git/hooks directory of every Git repository. Git automatically populates this directory with example scripts when you initialize a repository. 
Under .git/hooks these files will be present:
applypatch-msg.sample       pre-push.sample
commit-msg.sample           pre-rebase.sample
post-update.sample          prepare-commit-msg.sample
pre-applypatch.sample       update.sample
pre-commit.sample
.sample extension prevents them from executing by default. To “install” a hook, all you have to do is remove the .sample extension. Or, 
if you’re writing a new script from scratch, you can simply add a new file matching one of the above filenames, minus the .sample extension.
Ex: prepare-commit-msg hook. Remove the .sample extension from this script, and add the following to the file:
#!/bin/sh
echo "# Please include a useful commit message!" 
You should now see this message in place of the default commit message every time you run git commit
Pre-Commit:
The pre-commit script is executed every time you run git commit before Git asks the developer for a commit message or generates a commit object.
You can use this hook to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed. 
For example, you may want to run some automated tests that make sure the commit doesn’t break any existing functionality.
