Maven:

It is not only a  build tool for java application, it is also project management tool which manages the complete build lifecycle. Maven has the capabilities to 
extend the functionilty by adding plugins. 


maven commands:
mvn compile - used to compile source code
mvn clean -  cleans the previous build files
mvn test - run testing steps
mvn test-compile - compile code fo testing source
mvn package - creates artifacts
mvn install -  deploys packages and stores them in local repo
mvn deploy - artifacts are copied to remote repo

what maven build lifecycle /what are maven phases
1. Validate : Maven validates project is correct and necessary information is available in pom.xml
2. Compile: compiles the source code(java)
3. Test : Maven rund unit test cases on compiled. (Junit)
4. Package: it takes source code which is compiled and generated packages in distribution format (.jar/.war/.ear)
5. Integration Testing: Package is deployed in a environment where integration testing is done(selenium). 
6. Verify: verfies whether the package is valid or not.
7. Install: Installs package into local repository
8. Deploy: publish the build to release environment


Maven repositories:
1. Local repository - is a folder which is created on same machine where we run mvn command(.m2)
2. Central repository - repo is managed by maven community
3. Remote repository - confined to a organisation

Maven searched for dependencies(packages) in the following sequence:
local
central
remote
maven stops searching oncethe dependencies are found.
